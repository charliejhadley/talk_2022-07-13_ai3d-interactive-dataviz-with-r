# That title is too long

I'm going to talk about 4 things:

- R: What it is and the R user community

- [Static] Data visualisation with {ggplot2}

- Interactive data visualisation with R

- Reproducible research [and data visualisation with R]

### What do you get when you install R?

There are 3 things you get when you install R:

- The gubbins necessary to run R code

--

- A collection of R packages we call **base R** because *everyone* has them

--

- An application for running R code

.pull-left[
On macOS that application is called `R.app`
]

.pull-right[
On Windows that application might be called `Rgui.exe` or `R i386`.

]

> These are terrible ways to use R.

# RStudio

### RStudio is *the* place to write R code

RStudio is a traditional IDE designed for the R language.

It also provides built in tools for:

- Static data visualisation

- Interactive data visualisation with htmlwidgets

- Web application development with Shiny

- Reproducible research patterns with RStudio projects and RMarkdown.

> We're going to start using RStudio project NOW and explain why later.

# CRAN

## CRAN is where R lives

You downloaded R from CRAN. It's also the package repository for R.

It contains 18,000+ packages.

They're all<sup>1</sup> installed in the same way

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


.footnote[
1 - If available for the current version of R
]

## Packages you'll need

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(
  c(
    "tidyverse",
    "fivethirtyeight",
    "sf",
    "rnaturalearthdata",
    "leaflet",
    "plotly",
    "highcharter",
    "rmarkdown",
    "shiny"
  )
)
```
