This repo contains my 2022-07-13 talk for the [Artificial Intelligence for Scientific Discovery Network+ (AI3SD)](https://www.ai4science.network/ai3sd-event/13-14-07-2022-failed-it-to-nailed-it-nailing-your-data-visualisation-hands-on-workshop/) workshop *Nailing your Data Visualisation: Training Workshop*.

Please note that this talk is approximately 50% live coding so the slides won't make too much sense on their own. The materials I wrote during the talk can be found here - XXXX

During the talk I made use of this etherpad, [pad.riseup.net/p/2022-07-13_cjh](https://pad.riseup.net/p/2022-07-13_cjh). I've stored the contents of the etherpad in the `talk-etherpad.md` file.
